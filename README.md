UFO Data
### What data have been gathered?

The data (NUFORC ufo-reports) were gathered from planetsig's ufo-reports github
repository: https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports via command-line git.

### Data Exploration:

### Questions to be asked:
Are there specific times and places when/where alleged UFO sightings were
attested to with more certainty?

Operationalized as:
Do certain keywords in the notes, such as "sure", "positively", "definitely",
"absolutely", "certain", etc. appear more often in certain geographical locations
and decades?

### Modeling Approaches
- Logistic regression
